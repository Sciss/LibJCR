 'Working with live instruments in supercollider' (get it? :) ) . I guess people would need to bring an instrument or they could pair up with an instrumentalist. The topics would be:
1400: start
- introduce myself
- introduce yourself and what you want from the workshop
- setup dropbox
- setup musiccircle
- show the schedule
- setup recording

1415: topic 1: effects and live sampling
1500: upload and discuss!
1530: coffee
... repeat over:

- effects
  * delays, filters, pitch tracking 

- live sampling 
  * LiveSampler

- onset detection
  * triggering things with onsets
  * meta control of the live sampler with onset triggering

- beat tracking	
  * check out BeatTrack2 maybe if I get it to work

- pitch detection
  * MykFiddle

- markov chains
  * MykMarkov
